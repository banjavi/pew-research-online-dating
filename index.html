                    The topic of this visualization focuses on the online dating experiences of men and women, specifically exploring the question of who faces more challenges 
                    in this digital landscape. Dating apps have had a significant impact on society and have generated much debate regarding the differing
                    experiences of both genders. The inspiration for this visualization came from a YouTube video by Kidology titled 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhALIgyS4Ic" target="_blank">'Dating Apps: The New Class Struggle'</a> and 
                    a February 2023 article from the Pew Research Center called 
                    <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/02/02/from-looking-for-love-to-swiping-the-field-online-dating-in-the-u-s/" target="_blank">'From Looking for Love to Swiping the Field: Online Dating in the U.S.'</a>
                    The dataset used for this visualization is derived from the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/PI_2023.02.02_Online-Dating_TOPLINE.pdf" target="_blank">topline questionnaire survey results</a>
                     conducted by the Pew Research Center. 
                     <br><br>
                     The left chart in the visualization presents the argument that "Men have it harder on dating apps" by employing various rhetorical techniques and framing 
                     effects discussed in Hullman's paper <a href="http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/vis_rhetoric.pdf" target="_blank">Visualization Rhetoric: Framing Effects in Narrative Visualization
                    </a>. Some of the techniques used include:
                        <br><br>
                        - <b>Anchoring:</b> The color blue is used for men, creating a strong visual focus, while a less noticeable gray is used for women, directing the viewer's attention towards the male experience.
                        <br>
                        - <b>Filtering:</b> The dataset is selectively filtered to showcase only questions that lean towards men, highlighting their challenges in the online dating world.
                        <br>
                        - <b>Comparison:</b> By juxtaposing men's and women's experiences in each question, the viewer is encouraged to draw conclusions about the relative difficulty faced by each gender, influenced by the aforementioned techniques.
                        <br><br>
                    As a result, the audience is more likely to agree with the notion that men face significant challenges on dating apps, investing substantial resources without gaining much in return.
                    <br><br>
                    The right chart, conversely, employs similar techniques to advocate for the opposing viewpoint: "Women have it harder on dating apps." This chart's anchoring technique uses red for women and dark gray for men, 
                    shifting the focus towards women's experiences. The dataset is filtered to emphasize questions that support this argument, underscoring the various difficulties women encounter on dating apps. 
                    The comparison between men and women in each question further reinforces the narrative that women face unique challenges in their search for meaningful connections.
                    <br><br>
                    By presenting these contrasting charts side by side, the visualization encourages users to consider both perspectives and engage in a deeper conversation about the complexities of online dating for men and women.
